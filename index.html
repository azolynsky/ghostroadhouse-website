          <h3>L90: The Origin</h3>
          <p>
            The real-time, digital social deduction game where there are no
            moderators, no dying, and no sleeping. You’re a scientist. You never
            believed in ghost stories or things that go bump in the night. You
            graduated top of your class and accepted this mission in the arctic
            circle because you were the best. So explain yourself. Explain
            what’s happening. Explain how the door that could stop a truck was
            found flung from its hinges. Explain the sounds. Explain why you’re
            hiding under your desk with your dinner knife and saying prayers to
            any deity whose name you’ve ever heard? You’re a scientist, damnit.
            Explain yourself.
