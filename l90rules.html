        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>
          To start the game, the host should tap on "host game,"&nbsp;login if
          they have not logged in already, enter what they want to be called
          in-game, and tap "create game."
        </p>
        <p>
          After a game lobby is created, as many as 50 people may join using the
          game key at the top of the host's screen. The host may modify the game
          with optional roles, and then tap "start game."
        </p>
        <p>
          When the game starts, your role card will be shown. In a basic game,
          you will be either a Researcher (the "good guys") or The Origin (the
          basic Infected Master, found in every game).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST GAME</strong></em
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;L90 is a chaotic and loud game, which can
          make your first game hectic and a little difficult.&nbsp;To make it a
          little easier, we recommend using the first game as an opportunity to
          learn and focus on the interface on your phone.&nbsp;Get comfortable
          with sending and analyzing the samples, conducting tests, and using
          your clue card.&nbsp;If you are playing with someone who has played
          before, don't be afraid to ask them for help!&nbsp;They want you to
          have a good time (even if they are on the other team).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Fortunately, games are only 10 minutes long at max, so
          once you've gotten comfortable with the controls, you'll be able to
          jump into a second game right away and focus more on the group and the
          strategy.&nbsp;During your second game, try to piece together the
          clues and figure out who you can trust.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; By the end of this second game, you should feel like a
          pro.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>FIRST GAME RECOMMENDED SETUP</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p><strong>6-7 players:</strong> 1 Minion and 1 Origin</p>
        <p><strong>8-12 Players:</strong> 1 Origin and 1 Corruptor</p>
        <p><strong>13+ Players:</strong> 1 Origin, 1 Corruptor, and 1 Minion</p>
        <h3>Playing as a Researcher</h3>
        <p>
          Team: Researchers (duh)<br />Abilities: Send and analyze samples.
          Perform tests.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The goal is to find the other Researchers and pool your information
          with theirs. Collectively, you will find The Origin and any other
          Infected Masters.The Researchers have nothing to hide, so feel free to
          yell out any and all information you discover.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <em><strong>SEND SAMPLES</strong></em
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When the game starts, you will have a sample
          generated that you can send right away and a choice of a limited
          number of players to send it to. Send it to the person that you trust
          the most. After you do, you will isolate a new biological sample every
          30 seconds.&nbsp;Sending samples is always safe, but you'll still want
          to send it to a Researcher since they are the ones you can trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>ANALYZE SAMPLES</strong></em
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You will receive samples from other players
          throughout the game. If you receive a sample from someone you believe
          to be a Researcher, you should probably analyze it. If it is from a
          Researcher, the analysis will tell you true information about the
          game... maybe enough to determine who the Infected Masters are!
          However, if the sample is from The Origin, (or any Infected player who
          can infect you, such as a promoted Minion), you will become infected.
          Because of this, you should discard samples that you suspect are from
          the Infected team.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>SHARE INFORMATION AND LISTEN</strong></em
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever you get a noninfectious sample, you
          should share this information with the rest of the group. Remember,
          you have nothing to lose by sharing this information and nothing to
          hide; The Researchers must work together to find the Infected
          Masters.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to sharing analysis results
          yourself, you'll need to listen to what other people are sharing. The
          other Researchers should also be sharing any information they've
          gained.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Be careful though! The Infected team won't
          be sitting silently. They'll also be "sharing information"... meaning
          that they will be lying about what their analyses say! Figuring out
          who the Infected players are will help you know who to trust and who
          to ignore.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>TEST A PLAYER</strong></em
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When you think you know who The Origin (or any
          other Infected Master) is, you'll want to cast a vote to test a
          player. Tap on the player's icon, and then tap on "Vote to test
          [Player]" If 50% or more Researchers agree on the same person to test,
          a test is conducted on that player.&nbsp;It's important to remember
          that the Researchers only have a limited number of tests!<br />&nbsp;
          &nbsp; If the test is successful, the Researchers do not use up a
          test, and they learn that the person tested is an Infected Master. If
          the Researchers test all the Infected Masters, you win the game.<br />&nbsp;
          &nbsp; If the Researchers test someone who is not an Infected Master,
          they spend a test and learn that the player they tested is not an
          Infected Master. If the Researchers use up all their tests, they lose
          the game.
        </p>
        <h3>Playing as the origin</h3>
        <p>
          Team: Infected<br />Infected Master: Yes<br />Abilities: All samples
          sent from The Origin are Infectious.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The most important thing The Origin can do is NOT GET TESTED. To do
          that, you will have several tools at your disposal:
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong><em>KNOW EVERYTHING</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Origin and the rest of the Infected team know
          what roles the Infected team has, and who is on the Researcher team.
          They can use this to their advantage when they lie about what samples
          contain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>INFECT RESEARCHERS</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When a Researcher opens one of your samples, they
          will become an Infected Minion, and they will lie for the Infected
          team. Get as many players as you can on your side!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>PROMOTE MINIONS</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;If one of your minions is trusted by the
          Researchers, you can promote that minion. All you have to do is send
          them a sample, and when they open it they will gain a chance of
          generating an infectious sample, further helping to spread the
          infection.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>LIE</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When players send you samples, lie about what
          they say! You are one of the Infected Masters, so do everything you
          can to make the Researchers waste their tests on other players!
        </p>
        <h3>Playing as an Infected Minion</h3>
        <p>
          Team: Infected<br />Infected Master: No<br />Abilities: Can be
          promoted by The Origin (see "Getting Promoted" in the glossary)
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <em
            >So you've been possessed by an ancient horror that has been buried
            under ice for millennia... I know how it feels. But don't fret! All
            is not lost. You've got a new lot in life as an Infected Minion, and
            your main goal is to make sure that The Origin and any other
            Infected Masters do not get tested by the Researchers! How do you do
            this? Glad you asked!</em
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong><em>KNOW EVERYTHING</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Infected team know what roles the Infected
          team has, and who is on the Researcher team. They can use this to
          their advantage when they lie about what samples contain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>LIE</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Pretend you are still a Researcher! The
          Researchers don't know you got infected, so lie to them to throw them
          off the trail of The Origin and other Infected Masters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>GET PROMOTED</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you lie well enough, The Origin will favor
          you. Open more samples from The Origin to gain a chance at generating
          infectious samples yourself!
        </p>
        <h3>Playing as The Corruptor</h3>
        <p>
          Team: Infected<br />Infected Master: Yes<br />Abilities: Can be
          promoted by The Origin (see "Getting Promoted")
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Did someone just out themselves as a special Researcher role? Is a
            Researcher standing up, eyes full of excitement, and preparing to
            tell the group exactly who the Infected Masters are? Do you feel
            like just kind of being a jerk to your friend for no real reason?
          </p>
          <p>That's perfect because you're The Corruptor!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong><em>CORRUPT</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Once per game, simply tap on a Research Team
          member's name on your device, and then tap "Corrupt." They will
          immediately be turned into an Infected Minion.&nbsp;By using his
          ability early on, The Corruptor can gain a powerful ally
          immediately.&nbsp;By saving it until later, you can break into a
          circle of trust, giving The Origin an ally on the inside to spread the
          infection.&nbsp;And, since your samples aren't infectious, many of the
          Researchers will vouch for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>KNOW EVERYTHING</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You and the rest of the Infected team know what
          roles the Infected team has, and who is on the Researcher team. They
          can use this to their advantage when they lie about what samples
          contain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>LIE</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When players send you samples, lie about what
          they say! You are one of the Infected Masters, so do everything you
          can to make the Researchers waste their tests on other players!
        </p>
        <h3>Additional Roles</h3>
        <p>
          Once you've mastered the base game with The Origin, Corruptor,
          Infected Minions and Researchers, you may want to try out some of the
          more advanced roles!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>THE VECTOR</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Team: Infected<br />Infected Master: Yes<br />Abilities:&nbsp;Researchers
          that open samples from The Vector get unknowingly Promoted, and gain a
          +50% chance to generate Infectious samples without knowing it.
          Researchers who have this ability are still on the Researcher team.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>THE RESISTANT</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Team: Researchers<br />Abilities: The Resistant is immune to the
          Origin's (and only The Origin's!) Infection.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>THE SCANNER</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Team: Researchers<br />Abilities: When The Scanner opens a sample, in
          addition to the normal contents of the sample, they will see the role
          of the player who sent it to them.
        </p>
        <h3>GLOSSARY</h3>
        <p>
          <strong><em>TEAMS</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Players start on either the Infected team or
          the Researcher team, with roles distributed randomly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            ><em>WINNING THE GAME<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></strong
          >The Researcher team wins if they test all of the Infected Masters
          (see "Tests").<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Infected team wins if the
          Researchers run out of Tests (see "Tests"), if they run out of time
          (see "Timer"), or if every player is Infected.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>ISOLATING SAMPLES</strong></em
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; All players isolate a biological sample every 30
          seconds. These can be accessed through the tab on the left, titled "My
          Sample."&nbsp;These samples can be sent to other players. When a
          player receives a sample, they have the option to "analyze" the sample
          they received. A player may NOT analyze the samples that they isolate
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; When a sample is isolated, it will be designated either
          "infectious" or not infectious. This is determined when the sample is
          isolated, which means a sample may not become infectious later.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>ANALYZING SAMPLES</strong></em
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A player who has received a sample from another
          player may choose to analyze that sample or discard it. This can be
          accessed through the middle tab, "Analyze."&nbsp;If they choose to
          analyze it and the sample is not infectious, the sample will show them
          information about the state of the game. If the sample is analyzed and
          it is infectious, it will infect the player, turning them into an
          Infected Minion.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Analysis results are ALWAYS true. Even if a sample is
          sent from an infected player, the results of the analysis of their
          sample will be true.<br /><br /><em
            ><strong>GETTING INFECTED</strong></em
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If a Researcher gets infected, they become an
          Infected Minion and immediately switch to the Infected team.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>GETTING PROMOTED</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If The Origin sends a sample to another Infected
          player, when that player analyzes the sample they will gain an
          additional 50% possibility of generating an infectious sample in the
          future. The promoting ability is unique to The Origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>TESTS</strong></em
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tests are how the Researchers win the game. If a
          Researcher thinks they know who an Infected Master is, they may cast a
          vote for that player. They can do this by tapping on the player's name
          in the main window, and then tapping on "Vote To Test [Player]." If
          50% of the Researchers or more vote for the same player, a test will
          be used on that player. Infected players may not vote.<br />&nbsp;
          &nbsp; The Researchers have a limited number of tests. If they test a
          player and that player is not an Infected Master, they use up a test.
          If they use up all their tests, they lose the game.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
          If the Researchers test all the Infected Masters, the Researchers win
          the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>TIMER</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A game lasts 10 minutes. If <em>any</em> Infected
          Masters remain that have not been tested by the time the 10 minutes
          are up, the Infected team wins the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>BASIC ROLES</em></strong
          ><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Researcher
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">
          The Researchers have nothing to hide! They must share information and
          work together to figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying.
          The Researchers win if they test all the Infected Masters (see
          "Tests"). A Researcher will be turned into an Infected Minion if they
          open an infectious Sample (see "Infected Minions").
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">Origin</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">
          The Origin is an Infected Master. His/Her samples will infect
          Researchers who analyze them. If a sample from The Origin is analyzed,
          and the recipient is already infected, the recipient will become
          "promoted", and gain an extra 50% chance to generate an infectious
          sample.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">Corruptor</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">
          The Corruptor is an Infected Master. They have a one-time ability to
          infect someone on the Researcher team once per game (the Corrupted
          Researcher does not have a chance to resist infection).
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">
          The Corruptor can use their power by tapping on a player's name in the
          main window, and then tapping on "Corrupt."
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">
          The Corruptor is an optional role, customizable by the host and will
          not appear in every game.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">Infected Minions</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">
          Infected Minions are on the Infected team. They are NOT Infected
          Masters, and must protect the Infected Masters from the Researchers'
          tests. They usually do this by lying about the information they gain
          from their samples.
